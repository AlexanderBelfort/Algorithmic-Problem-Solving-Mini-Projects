Kids are usually taught to add multi-digit numbers from right to left one digit at a time. However, something very difficult for them to grasp is the carry operation - where we carry 1 from one digit position to be added to the next. The job here is to count the number of carry operations for each of a set of addition problems.

Each line of input contains two unsigned integers less than 10 digits. The last line of input should be 0 0. Output should be the carry operations for each line of input. Simple example could be if input was 850 51, the output should outline that here was one carry operation.

Example In:
123 456
555 555
123 594
0 0 

Example Out:
No carry operation.
3 carry operations.
1 carry operation.
