I've got a huge family all living in a single street in Los Angeles. Since I'll be visiting them very often, I'd like to find a house nearby. More specifically, I'd like to buy a house on the same street as them and minimise my walking distance when I go to visit.

The input consists of several test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line, with the first number in the line an integer representing the number of relatives in the test case, and each number in the line thereafter representing the house number of the relative.

Note that relatives could live in the same street number.

Output: For each test case, your program must output the minimal sum of distances from the optimal house in which I'll live to each of my relatives. The distance between two street numbers, s1 and s2 is d12=[s1-s2]
